# Initial notes and ideas for tasks in project

## Task 1: Iris
### Part 1: design/training and generalization
See chapter on linear classifier in the compendium. Some simple equations that will need to be implemented (20-23). Train using different alphas.

Write confusion matrix function. This will be used in all tasks, so a simple to use one is nice. Maybe there exist a built-in function? Or find something online? 

Either way, the results from the testing must be put into the required format for a confusion matrix. See [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdsp6soqA7o) and read in the compendium on how. 

### Part 2: features and linear seperability
Making histogram should be easy in Matlab. Plot in reasonable way (subplots?) and see which feature must be removed. Repeat above.

## Task 2: MNist
### Part 1: whole training set

### Part 2: clustering
